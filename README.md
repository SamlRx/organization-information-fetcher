# Project description
This project aims to bring an elegant way to complete a dataset of company name by fetching the company name from a website.

The project is divided into two parts:
- The first part is to scrape the company name from the website and the second part is to complete the dataset with the company name.
- The project is written in Python and uses the BeautifulSoup library to scrape the website and the pandas library to manipulate the dataset.
- The project is still in development and the final goal is to create a package that can be used by anyone to complete their dataset.
